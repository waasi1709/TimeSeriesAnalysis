##Time-Series Models: A Comparative Analysis

#Overview
This repository provides a systematic benchmarking framework to evaluate the robustness of various time-series forecasting models under controlled concept drift scenarios. We generate synthetic multivariate data with injected drifts and compare classical and modern architectures—ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, CNN, and TimeMoE—across multiple evaluation regimes.
